# KneeXpert – Artificial Intelligence System for Knee Joint Analysis and Diagnosis

## Project Overview

KneeXpert is an AI-powered system designed to assist doctors in diagnosing knee joint diseases through medical image analysis. The system utilizes deep learning models (CNN, Vision Transformer) to classify knee images and provide explainable diagnostic results.

## Research Objectives

- Improve the speed of knee disease diagnosis for patients
- Provide doctors with intelligent tools for faster and more accurate medical image analysis
- Reduce hospital overload caused by a high volume of imaging data
- Enhance early disease detection with higher precision
- Apply AI models in practice to shorten diagnosis time and improve healthcare quality
